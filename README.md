# Udacity Front-end Project 3: Surviving Evil, the game

A simple, frogger-like game to build upon the lessons I learned in the "Object
Oriented Programming" class, the "HTML5 Canvas" class, and the cute, little
"ReadME" class.

This project was mainly for my learning benefit, but there is some interesting
interactivity that allows a player to move around and try to avoid the evil
bugs.

## How to open the game:

Open index.html in a web browser.

JavaScript and HTML5 canvas are used to run the game.  Please make sure these
things are

## How to play the game:

Use the arrow keys to move around.

If you make it to water, you win, and get to try it again.

If you get eaten by evil, you lose, and get to try again.
