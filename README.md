# Udacity Front-end Project 3: Surviving Evil, the game

A simple, frogger-like game to build upon the lessons I learned in Udacity's:

- [Object Oriented Programming class](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015)
- [HTML5 Canvas class](https://www.udacity.com/course/html5-canvas--ud292)
- [ReadME class](https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777)

This project was mainly for my learning benefit, but there is some interesting interactivity that allows a player to move around and try to avoid the evil bugs.  Have fun if you **dare**.

## How to run the game:

If you're wondering how to run the game, well, it's as simple as downloading the zip file from the repo, unpacking it, and opening index.html in a browser.

If you're a slick rick, clone it.  :wink:

"Really, just opening index.html?" you exclaim!
"Yes'm.  That's it."  :thumbsup:

JavaScript and HTML5 canvas are used to run the game.  I hope you're browser isn't 10 years old.

## How to play the game:

Use the arrow keys to move around.

If you make it to water, you win :+1:, and get to try again.

If you get eaten by evil :trollface:, you lose, and get to try again.
