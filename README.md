# Udacity Front-end Project 3: Surviving Evil, the game

A simple, frogger-like game to build upon the lessons I learned in:

- the [Object Oriented Programming class](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015)
- the [HTML5 Canvas class](https://www.udacity.com/course/html5-canvas--ud292)
- the [ReadME class](https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777).

This project was mainly for my learning benefit, but there is some interesting interactivity that allows a player to move around and try to avoid the evil bugs, so have fun if you **dare**.

## How to open the game:

Open index.html in a web browser.

JavaScript and HTML5 canvas are used to run the game.  Please make sure the browser can use these features.

## How to play the game:

Use the arrow keys to move around.

If you make it to water, you win :+1:, and get to try again.

If you get eaten by evil :trollface:, you lose, and get to try again.
